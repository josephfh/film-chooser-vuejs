# film-chooser-vuejs

A little web app to allow a small audience to democratically pick a film
to watch from a shortlist, judging on the title, poster and tagline.

## To do
* keyboard input for 1st, 2nd, 3rd votes
* proper display of results and winner
* base the result on [Instant-runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting)
* use The Movie Database API to return film IDs instead of looking up manuall. If possible.
